Trexano99's 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions
==========================================

I chose to write the solutions in Python and maybe sometimes in Java because I 
am preparing two university exams on these programming languages.
I will try to write solutions (specially for Python) following a functional 
approach.

I won't spent any time benchmarking the code.

If you have questions about the code, please open an issue and ask away!
